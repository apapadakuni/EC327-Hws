 <h1> User Story 3</h1>
 <h2> Registerd User </h2>
 <p>As an existing already signed-up user, I want to change my personal information, my daily walking distance goal and add a new event just for this week. After I have signed in, I have the option of either viewing my schedule, updating my personal info, checking my goals and viewing my progress. First, I will view my schedule and then click on add event. I am going to enter all the necessary information about that event (location, time and date). Then I am going to go back and update my personal information, and enter my new weight when prompted. Then I am going back and going to update my personal goal from its previous value to the one I want. I click save and then a new generated schedule will appear which I am now going to follow. </p>
