<h2>Urban Citizen</h2>
<p>As an Urban Citizen, I do not ussually use Google Calendar, since I have different work and personal schedules.
  When I enter the website, I will register my account and sign up using my gmail. I will create a new schedule and input all 
  of my events, times and their locations. I am going to enter my daily walking distance goal in miles. Then the web application will return a schedule telling me the transpotation routes for my week.
