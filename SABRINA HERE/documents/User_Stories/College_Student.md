<h2>College Student</h2>
<p>
  As a College Student, I have a google cander to organize my daily life. When I enter the web application, I will first register with my gmail account and also put any personal information I want, such as height, weight, sex etc. Then I will import my google calendar and add locations to all events. I will set my daily goal for the ammount of calories I want to burn while walking, so that I can receive my schedule dictating when to walk and what transportation to take between my events.
